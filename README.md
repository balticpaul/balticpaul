- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @balticpaul
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web development and beer brewing.  I am actually a partner in a brewery but in a previous life I was a COBOL dev a loooong time ago.  Worked as an Azure tech and data analyst also.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Full Stack at The Odin Project. Just started today.  I am over 60, but learning is a life long process, right.
